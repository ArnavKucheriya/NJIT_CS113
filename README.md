Overview: <br>
This course is a comprehensive introduction to the Java programming language, writing, and testing of
programs. The course consists of three major parts. The first part teaches fundamental programming
techniques that use primitive data types, variables, assignment expressions, operators, and control
statements. The second introduces object-oriented programming, methods, parameter passing, recursion, and
arrays. The third part delves deeper into object-oriented programming by exploring inheritance, interfaces,
polymorphism, abstract classes and finally discussing exception handling.
